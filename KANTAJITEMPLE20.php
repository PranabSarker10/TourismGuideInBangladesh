                   <em><b>Description:</b></em>
                   <p></p>
                   Kantaji Temple, also known as the Kantanagar Temple, is located in the graceful heart of gorgeous countryside of Dinajpur. This is a stunning block of religious artwork, and is surely one of the most impressive Hindu monuments in Bangladesh.
                   <p></p>
                   Built in 1704-1752 A.D. by Pran Nath, a renowned maharaja from Dinajpur, and his adopted son Ram Nath, it is the country's finest example of brick and terracotta style. Its most remarkable feature, typical of late Mughal-era temples, is its superb surface decoration, with infinite panels of sculpted terracotta plaques.
                   <p></p>
                   This 15-sq-meter, three-story edifice was originally crowned with nine ornamental two-story towers, which collapsed during the great earthquake of 1897 and were never replaced. The temple is built on a high platform. This is a Nava-ratna temple. The roof of the ground floor and first floor each contains four sikharas or ratnas at their corners while the roof of second floor in its middle contains the ruins of the central sikhara.
                   <p></p>
                   The entire outer surface of the temple is exquisitely established with terracotta plaques which depict flora and fauna, geometric motifs, mythological scenes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and the contemporary social scenes and favorite pastime. The idol of Kantaji is kept in the garvagriha of the temple in its ground floor.
                   <p></p>
                   The department of Archaeology has been performing the necessary conservation and restoration works of Kantaji Temple since it was declared a protected monument by the Government in 1960. This is a UNESCO world heritage site.

                        <li> Every available inch of its wall surface from the base to the crest of its three stories, both inside and out, is decorated with amazing profusion of figured and floral terracotta art in unbroken succession </li>
                       <li> The vast array of subject matter include the stories of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, the exploits of Krishna, and a series of extremely fascinating contemporary social scenes depicting the favourite pastimes of the landed aristocracy.</li>
                       <li>Contrary to the earlier tradition of isolated and somewhat unrelated compostion, the art in this temple was composed of several individual plaques,integrated into an extended composition so that the entire space followed a rhythm.</li>

                     One can start his journey for the monument from Dinajpur town or Sayedpur Airport by any kind of motorized vehicle. We suggest travelers to hire a rickshaw van of take a ride by 'Nosimon' from the place called "Das Mile", which means 10 miles' upto "Baro Mile", which means 12 miles' boat point. It may take 10-20 Taka person for ride. You can also observe architectural beauty of 1704-1752 A.D. of the temple.
