The beach is about 30 kilometers in length, 6 kilometers in breadth and situated at the Lotachapli Union, Kolapara Thana, Patuakhali District. It's unique as there are no other beaches in Bangladesh where you can witness both sunrise and sunset. Jhaubon (Jhau forest) is an exquisite place in Kuakata which is close to the beach.
                   <p></p>
                   Jhau forest is established as a result of initiative taken by government. You can reach Jhaubon by walking from the beach. Jhaubon is covered by Jhau and coconut trees. It's a wonderful place for observing the sunrise. An Eco Park exists at Jhaubon area which is a fascinating place for picnic or junket. To the east of Jhau forest, there is Gangamati Reserved Forest.

                             <p></p>
                             The road distance from Dhaka to Patuakhali is 319 km. Compared to just 5 years back, it is much easier to go from Dhaka to Kuakata now. Though you will have to cross four ferries on the way, which takes a lot of time (around 2 to 4 hours depending on the ferry queue) – bridges are being built to make this journey faster. Here is some necessary information about the bus services running there.
                             <p></p>
                             Some of the bus services are listed below:
                             <p></p>

                                 If you want to make this trip truly memorable, you will have to hop on a launch or water vessel from Dhaka towards Patuakhali or Barishal. By this not only you can spend a few hours at one of these 2 cities (more like suburbs), but you can spend an amazing night on the Launch enjoying the cool breeze of the river and a clear starry sky. From Patuakhali or Barishal you need to get on a bus. It will take around 3-4 hours from Barishal and 2-3 hours from Patuakhali, counting the 3 ferries you will have to cross. Tickets are around 180Tk from Barishal.
                                 <p></p>
                                 Launches leave three times daily from the Dhaka to Patuakhali/Barishal – 5.30, 6.30 and 7.00 PM. Sundarban, Sattar Khan , Achol and Saikot Waterway conducts these services.
