                   <em><b>Description:</b></em>
                   <p></p>
                   Cox's Bazar is a town, a fishing port and district headquarters in Bangladesh. The beach in Cox's Bazar is an unbroken 120 km (75 mi) sandy sea beach with a gentle slope, is the world's longest. It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the industrial port Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, whose literal translation means "yellow flower." Its other old name was "Palongkee".
                   <p></p>
                   Today, Cox's Bazar is one of the most-visited tourist destinations in Bangladesh, though it is not a major international tourist destination. In 2013, the Bangladesh Government formed the Tourist Police unit to better protect local and foreign tourists, as well as to look after the nature and wildlife in the tourist spots of Cox's Bazar.

                   <ul>
                       <li> The vast sky and sea merge to let you know about their unity. You can enjoy the fiery sun rising from the sea and again sinking  under the sea in the evening. The beach sparkles like the pearl when light falls on the sand. </li>
                       <li> You'll get markets near the shore selling jewellery, show-piece etc. made of shells and again you can get stitched and unstitched clothes. </li>
                       <li> Walking along the sea beach at moonlit night, soft light of the moon over the head, the roar of the waves and cold touch of the wind, will make you nostalgic. </li>

                   <em><b>How to go:</b></em>
                   <p></p>
                   The ways to go from Dhaka to Cox's Bazar are given below:
                   <p></p>
                   <ul>
                             <li> <h4> Dhaka To Cox's Bazar By Bus : </h4>
                             <p></p>
                             Dhaka and Cox's Bazar are linked by road. You can take a bus from Dhaka to reach Cox's Bazar. Some of the bus services are listed below for your assistance:
                             <p></p>
                                 <img src="img/Cox'sbazarbus.jpg">
                             <p></p>
                             As you can see, some buses directly run to Teknaf and Ramu, crossing cox's bazar.
                             <p></p>
                             My Suggestion: Pick any AC (economy)  bus service and travel through the night. Best bus on this route is Hanif's B9R.     
                         <br>     
                         </li>
                             <li> <h4> Dhaka To Chittagong By Train : </h4>
                             <p></p>
                            There is no direct train service from Dhaka to Cox's Bazar. But if you crave for a train journey with your friends on your way to Cox's Bazar, hop on one of the 5 express trains that leave from Dhaka towards Chittagong. From Chittagong you will have to get on a bus to reach your final destination though.

                                 It would take you another 3.5 hours to reach cox's bazar from Chittagong. Also, trains in Bangladesh are known for delays in schedule. So if you can compromise your love for train rides, I would suggest traveling on a bus. But if you must, catch the Mohanogor Provati Express or Turna Nishitha.

                            This is the fastest way to travel to Cox's Bazar. Local lights to Cox's Bazar are offered by Regent Airways, NovoAir and United Airways.
