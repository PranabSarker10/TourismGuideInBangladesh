                   Satkhira region is mainly famous for the Sundarbans. Sundarbans is most large single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world. It lies between the vast Bay of Bengal Ocean and rivers of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, it spreads across Bangladesh and West Bengal in India. The waters of these rivers mix with the ocean water and so in this part of their flow the rivers are brackish or saline. Water covers the forest-islands twice a day during high tide.
                   <p></p>
                   It is considered a World Heritage site by UNESCO. The forest is mostly popular for incredible plants and wildlife. Trees having roots can breathe directly from the air. There are numerous species and it is mostly famous for Royal Bengal tiger. The forest safeguards people of north from cyclones and tsunami waves. Previously, the islanders were allowed to go into the forest to collect firewood, honey, crab and fish but now these activities have been banned by the governments of both Bangladesh and West Bengal.

                             There is a rocket paddle steamer service running six days between Dhaka to Khulna (without Fridays), through the vast rivers of this green delta. It departs at 6.30 PM for Halurhat inland port. The boat has two levels, the front side of the upper class is usually for first class cabins. Double cabins have two single beds, wash basin, fans and light. Single cabins hold the same, just one less bed. Two first-class cabins have a common room with sofa and dining table. But the real attraction of first class is in the front side of the upper deck, sit on the comfy chairs and enjoy the marvels of the Mighty Padma with a cup of hot tea or coffee.
                             
                         <br>
                             For the second class, rooms are smaller, no bed linens or wash basins. But there are some chairs outside the cabin to view the serenity and divinity of Bangladesh's most honored rivers. Just look at nature's impartialities, it doesn't matter if you are travelling to first or second class, you will get the same things from it. You just have to have the eyes to see.
